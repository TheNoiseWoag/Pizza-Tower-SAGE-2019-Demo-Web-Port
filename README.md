Welcome!

I'm trying to make a web port of the Pizza Tower SAGE 2019 Demo.

It will be hosted on x10Hosting, since its free and I don't want to pay money for a silly web port of a outdated demo for a game.

I don't know anything about coding, so this may take a while, but I will try to figure things out as I go along.

Why am I making this, you may ask?

...Good question.
